# Epidemic-Duration-Prediction-Model
We explore a standard epidemiological model, known as the SIRD model, to study the COVID-19 infection in Virginia.The time-dependent parameters are set in the model to obtain the best fit with the available data. The model is simulated aiming to project the probable features of the infection in Virginia,US.We find that with the current infection rate and containment measures, the total active infection in Virginia would be maximum at the end of  July 2020. With proper containment measures such as social distancing, the infection is expected to fall considerably from August.
